This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

## Loading and preprocessing the data
```{r}

#Load the data (i.e. read.csv())
df <- read.csv("activity.csv")

#Process/transform the data (if necessary) into a format suitable for your analysis
df$date <- as.Date(df$date)

```

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
```{r}
#histogram of the total number of steps taken each day
library(ggplot2)
total.steps.by.day <- aggregate(x = df$steps , by = list(df$date), FUN = sum ,na.rm=TRUE)
names(total.steps.by.day) <- c("date","steps")
histplot <- ggplot(total.steps.by.day,aes(x = steps)) +
            ggtitle("Histogram of daily steps") +
            xlab("Steps (binwidth 2000)") +
            geom_histogram(colour = "darkgreen", fill = "white",binwidth = 2000) +
            geom_vline(xintercept=mean(total.steps.by.day$steps , na.rm = TRUE),colour="red") +
            geom_vline(xintercept=median(total.steps.by.day$steps , na.rm = TRUE),colour="blue")
histplot

#mean total number of steps taken per day
mean(total.steps.by.day$steps , na.rm = TRUE)
#median total number of steps taken per day
median(total.steps.by.day$steps , na.rm = TRUE)

```
